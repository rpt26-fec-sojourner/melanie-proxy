Carolyn's: Changed mongo connection address to 'mongodb://localhost/photogallery'
Justin's: client/lib/api.js URL creator function was using the proxy host for the address and needed to call his own server port for his API calls to match up: changed   // let url = `${protocol}//${host}`; to: let url = `${protocol}//localhost:7878`;
